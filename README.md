# Road-accident-Analysis

## Overview

This README provides details on the dataset related to road accidents. The dataset includes various attributes that capture essential information about each accident. Below, you'll find brief descriptions of each data field.

## Data Fields

1. **Accident_Index**: Unique identifier for each accident.
2. **Accident Date**: The date the accident occurred.
3. **Month**: Month of the accident.
4. **Year**: Year of the accident.
5. **Day_of_Week**: Day of the week the accident occurred.
6. **Junction_Control**: Type of control at the junction.
7. **Junction_Detail**: Details about the junction.
8. **Accident_Severity**: Severity of the accident.
9. **Latitude**: Latitude coordinate of the accident location.
10. **Light_Conditions**: Lighting conditions at the time of the accident.
11. **Local_Authority_(District)**: Local authority district.
12. **Carriageway_Hazards**: Hazards present on the carriageway.
13. **Longitude**: Longitude coordinate of the accident location.
14. **Number_of_Casualties**: Number of casualties in the accident.
15. **Number_of_Vehicles**: Number of vehicles involved.
16. **Police_Force**: Police force responsible for the area.
17. **Road_Surface_Conditions**: Condition of the road surface.
18. **Road_Type**: Type of road where the accident occurred.
19. **Speed_limit**: Speed limit at the location.
20. **Time**: Time the accident occurred.

22. **Weather_Conditions**: Weather conditions at the time.
23. **Vehicle_Type**: Type of vehicle(s) involved.

## Additional Resources

- **Datasheet**: You will find the datasheet in the file named "Drive Link for Datasheet".
- **Dashboard**: The project dashboard is available as "RAD Dashboard".
- **Analysis File**: The analysis file can be found in "Data Analysis Sheet".

## Usage

This dataset can be used for:

- Analyzing trends and patterns in road accidents.
- Identifying factors contributing to accident severity.
- Developing predictive models for accident occurrence.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of road safety measures.

## Notes

- The dataset includes information on total casualties, casualty breakdowns by severity, and casualties by vehicle type.
- Data on casualties by road type, surface, light conditions, and weather conditions is available for further detailed analysis.
- Ensure to clean and preprocess the data as necessary before analysis.
- Handle missing or null values appropriately.
- Verify the accuracy of geolocation data (latitude and longitude) if used for precise mapping.

This dashboard and dataset provide critical insights and areas of improvement for road safety measures. By understanding the provided data fields and their meanings, users can better utilize the dataset for their specific research and analysis needs.
